<h2>Description</h2>
The Aurora experiment, Department of Homeland Security conducted at the Idaho National Laboratory, highlights critical cybersecurity vulnerabilities in infrastructure systems. By compromising a diesel generator's protective relay with minimal code, the experiment demonstrated potential risks to power grids and emphasized the need for robust security measures. Understanding this experiment is essential for identifying weaknesses in industrial control systems and developing effective security protocols. The insights gained help enhance system resilience and prepare organizations to better handle cyberattacks. Additionally, it serves as a valuable educational example for cybersecurity professionals and researchers, reinforcing the importance of protecting critical infrastructure against evolving threats.
